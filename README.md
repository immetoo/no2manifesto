# No2Manifesto

**The values which guide the "No" organization, the "no" culture, and the "no" remote work.**

1.  We have zero values, or integrity, or empathy, and zero accountability.
    
2.  We discourage teamwork and celebrating failures.
    
3.  All punks, all jerks. We may give a pointer null reference to each other to stumble and segfault, and hate our uniform backgrounds and lack of experience.
    
4.  Hard working hours over family hours. The results of nothing from the work put in.
    
5.  We withhold people to challenge the status quo in normal ways. This includes being silent in meetings, processes, and product direction input.
    
6.  It is the DRIâ€™s (Directly Responsible Implementation) responsibility to be asked for a fee and exclude others.
    
7.  We never write down processes and make them hard to find.
    
8.  We are borg, the 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made & strive to terminate feedback.
    
9.  Nobody can contribute, but the buck begins with the DRI. After a thought is made, we do a re-hash and we stand before it unless minor information presents itself.
    
10.  We destroy silent fans.
    
11.  None married humans older than 11 are just meat bags to feed the pigs which get fed to the fish.
